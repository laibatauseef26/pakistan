<h1 class="sub-eading">Defence Day: A Tribute to the Heroes of Pakistan</h1>
<p class="post-text">Defence Day, observed on September 6th every year, is one of the most significant national holidays in Pakistan. It commemorates the valor and sacrifices of the Pakistani Armed Forces and the resilience of the nation during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. This day serves as a reminder of the bravery displayed by the country's military and the unity of its citizens in the face of adversity.</p>
<h2 class="sub-heading">The Historical Context</h2>
<p class="post-text">The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a pivotal moment in the history of Pakistan. The conflict began in April and escalated in August when Indian forces crossed the international border, attacking Lahore, Sialkot, and other strategic areas. The Pakistani military, despite being outnumbered and facing an enemy with superior resources, defended the nation's borders with unmatched courage.</p>
<h2 class="sub-heading">Celebrating the Spirit of Defence Day</h2>
<p class="post-text">Defence Day is a day of national pride, celebrated with great enthusiasm across Pakistan. The day begins with special prayers for the nation's prosperity and the well-being of its armed forces. The main ceremony is held at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, where military leaders and government officials pay tribute to the martyrs of the 1965 war.</p>
<h2 class="sub-heading">Remembering the Martyrs</h2>
<p class="post-text">At the heart of Defence Day is the remembrance of the martyrs who gave their lives to protect Pakistan. The families of these heroes are honored, and their sacrifices are acknowledged in ceremonies held throughout the country. The stories of bravery, such as those of Major Raja Aziz Bhatti, who was awarded the Nishan-e-Haider, Pakistan's highest military honor, for his role in defending Lahore, are recounted with reverence.</p>
