<h1 class="sub-eading">Allama Iqbal: The Poet of the East and Visionary Leader</h1>
<p class="post-text">Allama Muhammad Iqbal was born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, Punjab (now in Pakistan). His early education took place in Sialkot and Lahore, where he exhibited a remarkable intellect and a deep interest in philosophy. He furthered his education in the United Kingdom, studying at Cambridge University and later at Lincoln's Inn to train as a barrister. Despite his legal training, Iqbal’s true passion lay in philosophy and literature, which led him to study in Germany, where he integrated Western philosophical thought with Islamic principles.</p>
<h2 class="sub-heading">Literary Contributions</h2>
<p class="post-text">Iqbal’s poetry, written in both Persian and Urdu, is celebrated for its philosophical depth and spiritual insight. His notable works include "Bang-e-Dra" (The Call of the Marching Bell), "Asrar-e-Khudi" (The Secrets of the Self), and "Rebel" (The Rebel). His poetry explores themes of self-realization, individual and collective identity, and a call for the revival of Islamic thought and cultural renewal.</p>
<h2 class="sub-heading">Leadership and Legacy</h2>
<p class="post-text">Although Iqbal did not live to see the creation of Pakistan in 1947, his contributions were pivotal in the independence movement. He is honored as Pakistan’s national poet, with his birthday, November 9, celebrated as Iqbal Day. The Iqbal Mausoleum in Lahore, also known as Iqbal Park or Iqbal's Tomb, serves as a tribute to his enduring influence. His works continue to inspire and reflect his profound impact on South Asian and Islamic intellectual traditions.</p>
<h2 class="sub-heading">Political Involvement</h2>
<p class="post-text">Initially aligned with the Indian National Congress, Iqbal’s political views evolved towards advocating for a separate nation for Muslims. His vision for an independent Muslim state was articulated in his Allahabad Address of 1930, which proposed the creation of a separate Muslim state in the northwestern regions of India. This vision was instrumental in shaping the political landscape and contributed to the establishment of Pakistan.
